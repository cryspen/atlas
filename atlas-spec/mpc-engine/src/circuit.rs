//! The [`Circuit`] representation used by the MPC engine.
//!
//! A circuit is made up of logic gates and value-carrying wires between the
//! gates. Each gate takes one or more wires as input, depending on the type of
//! gate, and has exactly one output wire.
//!
//! Conceptually, a circuit is a sequence of input or logic (XOR/AND/NOT) gates,
//! with all input gates at the beginning of the sequence, followed by all logic
//! gates. The index of a gate in the sequence determines its "wire index",
//! which is available as the input to any gate later in the sequence. For
//! example, in a circuit with two input gates (1 bit for party A, 1 bit for
//! party B), followed by three logic gates (an XOR of the two input gates, an
//! AND of the two input gates, and an XOR of these two XOR/AND gates), the
//! input gates would be the wires 0 and 1, the XOR of these two input gates
//! would be specified as `Gate::Xor(0, 1)` and have wire index 2, the AND of
//! the two input gates would be specified as `Gate::And(0, 1)` and have wire
//! index 3, and the XOR of the two logic gates would be specified as
//! `Gate::Xor(2, 3)` and have wire index 4:
//!
//! ```text
//! Input A (Wire 0) ----+----------+
//!                      |          |
//! Input B (Wire 1) ----|-----+----|-----+
//!                      |     |    |     |
//!                      +-XOR-+    |     |
//!         (Wire 2) =====> |       |     |
//!                         |       +-AND-+
//!         (Wire 3) =======|========> |
//!                         +---XOR----+
//!         (Wire 4) ==========> |
//! ```
//!
//! The input gates of different parties cannot be interleaved: Each party must
//! supply all of their inputs before the next party's inputs can start.
//!
//! At least one input bit must be specified, and every party contributing
//! inputs to the circuit has to specify at least one input bit. Party input
//! gates may not refer to other input gates' wire indices.
//!
